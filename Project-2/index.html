						<p>Whether you are planning a getaway in August or dreaming of a longer-term trip, here are all the resources you need for flights, accommodations, restaurants and even excursion. And a word to the wise?  According to Kayak.com, after the busy summer months of July, June and August, airfares will drop for September and October.</p>
						<p>So if you are budget-concious, think about planning a fall vacation.Two of the best sites for cheap tickets are <a href="https://www.kayak.com/">Kayak</a> and <a href="http://www.skyscanner.com/">Skyscanner</a>. Liz Carlson , travel blogger behind Young Adventuress, has recommended Skyscanner here before because the website has a destination-flexible search option.  If you know you want to go somewhere and location doesn’t matter, I would recommend this site. Kayak allows users to search whole months for the cheapest fare, so if you don’t have a strict vacation schedule and want to save some bucks, this can be a great tool.</p>

							<p>Nashville has been dubbed Music City. Austin, Texas, carries the motto "Live Music Capital of World."</p>
							<p>We beg to differ. Frankly, it's hard to fathom a city in the world that offersmore music festivals than Chicago. Summer is legitimately on. When you're not hanging out on a rooftop bar, you should be soaking up the sun at a summer music festival or taking advantage of the weather at an outdoor concert. We throw a music festival every weekend in the summer—sometimes more than one. Hell, we have a music festival in January. And that's just the music festivals. We have yet to mention the baroque theaters, the dive bars, the dance clubs, the blues clubs, the grassy amphitheatres,the wineries and jazz clubsthat host killer concerts every day. Yes, it can be overwhelming, which is where we come in.</p>

						<p>A vacation is a respite from your daily life and work, a time for relaxation and fun. Still, a vacation can involve planning, and a lot of planning can start to feel uncomfortably like work.</p>
						<p>To simplify planning and budgeting, consider choosing an all-inclusive resort for your next vacation.The idea behind an all-inclusive resort is to have everything you need available right on the premises. This usually includes accommodations, buffets and restaurants, outdoor activities and games, shops and entertainment. Many all-inclusives are Caribbean or Mexican beach resorts complete with swimming pools, tennis courts and more,  but some are located in the midst of mountain scenery, along whitewater rivers, in winemaking regions and in other beautiful, interesting parts of the world.</p>

						<p>More than 50 million people visit New York City every year. The five boroughs -- or regions -- of New York have some of the most easily recognized attractions in the world.</p>
						<p>Visitors on a budget can take a free boat from Manhattan to Staten Island  for a great view of the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline. Your guide shares informative commentary at all of the sights as you take in the Big Apple on this comprehensive tour. America’s third-largest city offers world-class museums, great food, sporting events, and iconic architecture -- including Willis Tower, America’s tallest  building. The Midwest city is also known for comedy. The Second City theater is where many famous comedians got their start, including Mike Meyers and Tina Fey.</p>
